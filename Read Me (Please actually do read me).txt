///////////       FOR EVERYONE       ///////////////

    The guidlines are simple: in this mod, every level of every ability is completely different. Make changes to the kv file at "game/dota_addons/communityeffort/scripts/npc/npc_abilities" to adjust the basica behavior of an ability.
It is recmonended that you do something extra when the ability is fired, to add another level of behavior, such as adding 50% status resistence for the duration of the ability when it is fired.
There are instrutions in the template for accomplishing this sort of thing.
    Also, the base ability class has been extended. Carefully look at "scripts\internal\extend_ability_class" to see what is possible with these new methods.

    Give OTHERS credit if they gave you some code or you altered code written by them, and include where you got the code from. ALWAYS get permissions before using someone else's code.

Make Requests!
    If you would like to see another template (for custom items and such) or new extensions to the ability or gamemode base classes, message me directly in Discord

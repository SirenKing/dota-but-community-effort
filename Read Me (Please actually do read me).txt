///////////       FOR EVERYONE       ///////////////

    Every ability is different at every level. That is the besis of this mode. Blade fury might be normal at level one, but at level two it might attack all enemies in its radius one time, for instance.
    To alter a specific ability by level, do to the appropriate ability in "npc/npc_abilities.txt." To add a special modifier that gets added when the ability is cast, go to "scripts/vscripts/heroes" and find the apprpriate hero. If the hero file is not yet created, feel free to copy the template and rename it to the correct hero name.
    The guidlines are simple: in this mod, every level of every ability is completely different. Make changes to the kv file at "game/dota_addons/communityeffort/scripts/npc/npc_abilities" to adjust the basica behavior of an ability.
It is recmonended that you do something extra when the ability is fired, to add another level of behavior, such as adding 50% status resistence for the duration of the ability when it is fired.
There are instrutions in the template for accomplishing this sort of thing.
    Also, the base ability class has been extended. Carefully look at "scripts\internal\extend_ability_class" to see what is possible with these new methods.
